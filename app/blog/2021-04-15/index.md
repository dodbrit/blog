## Welcome!

As a quick introduction, my name is Peter Keech. I’m a DevOps (DevSecOps) Engineer working in the government sector and a U.S. Air Force Veteran. I have a passion for all things DevOps and I am always learning new things about the technology.

<!--truncate-->

The goal of this blog is to hopefully become a collection of lessons learnt throughout my journey in aiding the government in adopting DevOps policies and practices, as well as documenting my own growth along the way.

Hopefully, some of the lessons learnt here will help you in achieving the goals you have set out to complete.

Cheers for taking the time to visit my blog.
