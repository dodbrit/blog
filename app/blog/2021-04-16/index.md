Good afternoon and happy Friday! Thanks to the wonderful [Network Chuck](https://youtu.be/gwUz3E9AW0w), today is day one of this website. As a beginning post I thought I would start with a free DevOps certification.

<!--truncate-->

Rancher is one of the leading companies when it comes to all things DevOps (they haven’t paid me to say that). As a commitment to the community, late last year *Rancher* released a no cost certification for their Rancher platform. While the certification is about Rancher’s cluster management tool, the certification is a great entry into the world of *Kubernetes*.

Hopefully before my next post, I will be Rancher Operator certified! 

Have a great weekend everyone!

Cheers,

Peter
