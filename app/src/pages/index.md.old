# Welcome

As a quick introduction, my name is Peter Keech. Iâ€™m a DevOps (DevSecOps) Engineer working in the government sector and a U.S. Air Force Veteran. I have a passion for all things DevOps and I am learning new things about the technology everyday.

The goal of this website is to hopefully become a collection of lessons learnt throughout my journey in aiding the government in adopting DevOps policies and practices, as well as documenting my own growth along the way.

Hopefully, some of the lessons learnt here will help you in achieving the goals you have set out to complete.

Cheers for taking the time to visit my website.
