Thanks to the wonderful Network Chuck, today is day one of this website. As a beginning post I thought I would start with a free DevOps certification.
Note
As a quick update, I have successfully passed the Rancher Operator: Level One!
As I previously mentioned, despite the fact that this is a Rancher certificate that is obviously geared towards the Rancher product, I highly recommend this certification for anyone that is new to the Kubernetes world or needs a refresher for the matter.</description></item></channel></rss>
